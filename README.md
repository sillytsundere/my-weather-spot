# Paige's Weather Place

## Description

I have a primal desire to travel and see as much of this world with my own two eyes as I can during my short time here. This web application serves to assist my acheivement of that goal. 

This weather application displays the current forcast for a desired city as well as the future forcast over a 5 day period. This application can make it easier for those who are frequently traveling to view the current and future weather conditions for the cities they wish to travel to. The search history section also allows users to easily view cities they have recently searched and recheck the weather conditions of that city. This can aid in comparing weather conditions of searched cities when choosing where to travel.

This application required me to become familiar with API's and making fetch requests from them. It also allowed for extra practice traversing the fetched objects from the API library. I was also able to practice with some basic elements of bootstrap styling, as there is no basic css in this web application. 

## Installation

To run the code, clone the project directories from [my repository](https://github.com/sillytsundere/my-weather-spot) and open the index.html and script.js files in preferred code editor. The HTML file can be viewed to examine the basic display elements and how they are organized on the webpage. Styling elements from bootstrap can also be seen in the HTML file. The Javascript file can be viewed to inspect the interactivity of the webpage as well as dynamically created elements.


## Usage

To use this app, once on the homepage a user will type a desired city into the search bar. Upon clicking "Submit" the current weather conditions for that city will be displayed to the right. A button will appear below the search form for that recently searched city. Further searched cities will be listed under the search form as buttons, with the most recent at the top so users can click a recently searched city to view the weather conditions for that city again.

The City information listed includes the date, a weather icon depicting the current weather conditions, temperature, wind speed and humidity. These pieces of information are also listed in the 5 day forcast section which describes weather conditions for the next 5 days. If the user has visited the site previously, their previous city searches will populate underneath the search form, pulled from local storage.
